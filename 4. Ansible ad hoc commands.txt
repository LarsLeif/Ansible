# it is one-liner ansible command that performs one task on the target host/group

# it will only have two parameters, the group of a host that you want to perform the task and the Ansible module to run

# module: small programs that do some work on the server

# modules are the main building blocks of Ansible and are basically reusable scripts that are used by Ansible Ad-hoc and playbooks
